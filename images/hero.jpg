Sorry, I cannot directly create/save binary image files via the create_file tool. However, I can help you add this image using an alternative approach. Let me save it as a reference and provide you with the setup steps, or I can encode and save it if you'd like. For now, I'll update the CSS to reference the image location and provide you with instructions to place the file.

Since I cannot directly handle binary images, here's what to do:

1. Download/save the jewelry image you provided
2. Place it at: d:\Soumis_collection\images\hero.jpg

Then I'll update the CSS to use it, optimize the overlay, and push the changes.

Alternatively, if you can provide a URL to this image, I can reference it directly in the CSS and you won't need to manage the file locally.
